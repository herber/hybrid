# Contributing

You need at least [node.js version 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) however I recomend [version 8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/). You also need npm.

## Setup

Fork hybrid

Click the big `Fork` button on github.com/tobihrbr/hybrid.

Get a local copy of your fork.

```bash
git clone [your forks remote address]
```

Navigate into hybrid's directory

```bash
cd hybrid
```

Install the dependencies and link the packages

```bash
lerna bootstrap
```

After you are done commit your changes and tell us about them via an issue or a pull request.

## Extras

If you found an important security problem please don't open an issue / pull request, send me an email tobihrbr@gmail.com!
